TIMESYNC

	It would not be amiss to recall that time based OTPs are based off of
	the current time.  So, make sure the time is accurate on your host, or
	the time based OTPs will not validate.  For example, chrony package
	can synchronize your clock:

		# pkgman install --deps --group chrony
		# /etc/rc.d/chronyd start

End of file.
