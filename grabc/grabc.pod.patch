-grabc - A tool to identify a pixel color of an X Window.
+grabc - identify a pixel color of an X Window
 
 =head1 SYNOPSIS
 
- grabc v1.0.2
- A program to identify a pixel color of an X Window
- by muquit@muquit.com https://www.muquit.com/
- 
- Usage: grabc [options]
- Where the options are:
-  -v         - show version info
-  -h         - show this usage
-  -hex       - print pixel value as Hex on stdout
-  -rgb       - print pixel value as RGB on stderr
-  -W         - print the Window id at mouse click
-  -w id      - window id in hex, use -l +x+y
-  -l +x+y    - pixel co-ordinate. requires window id
-  -d         - show debug messages
-  -a         - Print all 16 bits of color. Default is high order 8 bits
- Example:
- * Print pixel color in hex on stdout:
-    $ grabc
- * Show usage:
-    $ grabc -h
- * Print Window Id (Note the upper case W):
-    $ grabc -W
- * Print pixel color of Window iwith id 0x13234 at location 10,20
-    $ grabc -w 0x13234 -l +10+20

 =head1 DESCRIPTION
 
-grabc is a simple but very useful program to determine the color string in 
-hex (or in RGB components) by clicking on a pixel on the screen. While web 
-browsing, lots of time you find a nice color and wonder what color is that. 
-Well just use grabc!
+grabc is a simple but very useful program to determine the color string in hex
+(or in RGB components) by clicking on a pixel on the screen.
+
+When this program is run, the mouse pointer is grabbed and changed to a cross
+hair and when the mouse is clicked, the color of the clicked pixel is written
+to stdout in hex prefixed with #.
